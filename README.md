# 🐶🐱 CNN Cat vs Dog Classifier  
   
## 📌 Project Overview       
This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify images of cats and dogs. The model is trained using deep learning techniques on labeled datasets to achieve high accuracy in distinguishing between the two classes.  

## 🚀 Features  
- Image classification using **CNN**   
- Preprocessing and augmentation of images  
- Training and evaluation on labeled datasets  
- Visualization of training performance  
- Model saving and loading for inference  
 
## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **TensorFlow / Keras**  
- **OpenCV** (for image processing)  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for visualization)  
- **NumPy & Pandas** (for data handling)  

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset consists of labeled images of **cats and dogs**. If using a public dataset, you can download it from the link below
